# checking-and-replacing-null-values-with-mean
In this repository, I explore how to handle null values in data by replacing them with the mean value of the corresponding column. The code demonstrates an efficient way to handle missing data and maintain data integrity for accurate analysis and modeling. Check out the code and feel free to provide feedback or suggest improvements.
